# 📈 Sales Data Analysis – Advertising Impact on Sales using Linear Regression

This project investigates how **advertising budgets across TV, Radio, and Newspaper** platforms influence product **sales performance**. Using **Linear Regression**, we aim to quantify the impact of each advertising channel and identify which mediums are most effective for driving sales.

The dataset is ideal for understanding basic predictive modeling and interpreting real-world business data using machine learning techniques.

## 📌 Objectives

- Explore and analyze relationships between advertising expenditures and product sales.
- Apply **Simple** and **Multiple Linear Regression** to model the influence of marketing channels.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as R² and Mean Squared Error.
- Visualize data trends and regression lines for interpretation and business decision support.

## 🔍 Analysis Steps

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution of ad spends and sales
   - Correlation heatmap between variables

2. **Regression Modeling**
   - Built separate models: 
     - Simple Linear Regression (e.g., TV vs Sales)
     - Multiple Linear Regression (TV + Radio + Newspaper)
   - Compared model accuracy and coefficients

3. **Visualization**
   - Plotted regression lines and scatter plots
   - Visualized feature importance and residuals

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- **TV and Radio** showed strong positive correlation with sales.
- **Newspaper** had minimal or no significant impact on sales.
- The multiple regression model gave better predictive accuracy compared to individual models.
- These insights can guide future budget allocation across marketing channels.
